**Profile/Login/Signup Pages**

I created the initial profile page and made simple API endpoints to retrieve the profile information, make a new profile when logging into SyncBoard, and edit a profile information. I created the React component to allow for users to interact with their profile data. In addition I implemented the login/signup pages. Along the way, my teammates made small modifications to the profile API endpoints to make it work with the ever-changing schema structure we have for our current database.

**Session Variables**

I just started in creating the very early stages of the session endpoints and in trying to implement session variables into the frontend. However, Joe was able to pick up where I was stuck and finish implementing the session variables on the frontend.

**Tasks**

I connected the task frontend to the backend using task API endpoints that Morgan created. In addition, I restructed the schema validation for tasks so that the database can store the status of a task in addition to what the schema validated before.
