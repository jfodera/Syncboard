# To Do  :
   - Calendar√
   - resources page√
   - make sure task page is good √
   - finish login √
   - hash passwords for signup, edit login √
   - password requirements for it to be good.  √
   - add login checkers to each page  √
   - make sure workspace Cards correlate to the actual class (grace) √
   - logout button, cannot acsess login page if already logged in √
   - actual calendar representation  √
      - Adding onclick to the card so that is sets the current session groupID 
      - when user clicks into class on workspace page, set a session variable for group-id user is currently in
      - whenever a new class is clicked on reset that variable
      - use that variable to make the calendar work 
      - calendar.js:217
   - make sure all other pages work 
   - not allowed to get passed workspaces unless session groupID variable is set?
   - professors randomizing 
   - verify CSS 
   - have mention of Stack (MERN) on README 
   - Add Rate Limits
   
# Demo Script: 
   - Login with account that already exists
   - explain the workspaces page and how that data loads, what happens when I click on a workspace
      - where groups and classes are coming from -> show DB items
   - Morgan talks about calendar and functionalities 
   - Ryan talks about tasks and adds some fake ones 
      - adds some new ones
   - Grace hits the chat (explains everything)
   - Aditya does resouces team 
   - I talk about profile and inability to edit rin because it would break everything 
   - create lebron, explain how fetching of classes work and the entirety of the flow of importing classes and groups 
   - Lebrons Account, showing that it automatically adds him into the classes 
   - Mobile Morgan 


# Project requirements: 
   - front end in react
   - Use API
   - Use all technologies talked about in class
   - Have a group and chat API 
   - MERN Stack 
      
# Good Users to create Key: 
   - 1 group from each course 
   - some overlap where one user is in multiple groups

# VM Configs: 
   - sudo npm install express-session
   - sudo npm install cors
   - sudo npm install bcrypt
   - sudo npm install crypto
   - change over to VM URL's 
   - set to true when on VM: cookie: { secure: false }  
   - fix browser errors when going back and fourth between pages 
   - set up env

# App Conventions/Descriptions
   - Class data would be scrapped from somewhere so that the professor doesn't have to hardcode that in. 
   - then when a user signs up, the class data is checked for their rin, if that is 
   - on the workspace page, classes only show up if you are already in a groupa s that is the whole entire point of the appplication 
   - used react router DOM for smooth navigation 

# Things I learned/Citations : 
   - Viewport width= based off of the visible area of the web browser 
   - https://fullcalendar.io/
   - https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.sitepoint.com/css-viewport-units-quick-start/%23:~:text%3DViewport%2520width%2520(%2520vw%2520)%2520is%2520a,unit%2520is%2520denoted%2520as%2520vw&ved=2ahUKEwie-Ofk7t2LAxWEFlkFHZ65NosQFnoECBIQAw&usg=AOvVaw2mvCFeWPdkCQBak1h3acVz
   - Browser Router -> aka a single Page Application
      - this works because when we reload it sends back the html page and then the page we are reloading from is handled by the browser: 
         ```
         app.get('*', (req, res) => {
            res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html'));
         });
         ``` 

   - this is an absolute path: <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css">
   - this is a relative path: <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
      - reltive breaks browser router when 2 deep like: 'class/resources' 
   - Javascript Session Middleware: 
      - (see comments on server.js on what I learned)
      - https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Javascript+session+middleware%3A&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8]
      - app.use runs in between each get call (thus middleware)
      - //cookie links the client to the session, session is not a cookie
   - React Browser, Sessions are stored on server side, so in order to retrieve session variables, react must make API calls 
   - CORS -> Data (like session variables) acsess manager for JS: 
      - https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS&ved=2ahUKEwjNlrPv19eMAxVxvokEHQ1LKegQFnoECBkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2xmyG8mpAqKyMiOwPBDkob
   - difference between for in and for of: 
      - https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29285897/difference-between-for-in-and-for-of-statements&ved=2ahUKEwjo2oHj99eMAxWmvokEHSBWFrsQFnoECBgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1oRcWABDTPWc4BWsFyXsxa
   - Always encrypt passwords on server side: 
      - https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://medium.com/%40patilchetan2110/password-encryption-and-decryption-in-node-js-using-bcrypt-package-5a7b1952d49d&ved=2ahUKEwil-vrr_NeMAxUSl4kEHTO8HzMQFnoECBUQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0i4FlYUanMMrvR79yv5r3X
   - password hadhing in bcrypt 
      - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-hash-passwords-with-bcrypt-in-nodejs/
   - when server restarts session is cleared 
   - don't make useeffect async 
   - Conditionals in line with JSX 
      - https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html&ved=2ahUKEwj8iPLjxtiMAxUrFVkFHbdIAlgQFnoECBgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw35iJf_iuDEpRKBcK713PlE
   - brackets in any jsx allows you to write js: {console.log(loggedIn)}
   - hook allows you to 'hook' into existing react elements, or edit certain features 
   - when you have multiple useEffect features: 
      - they run in order of how they appear in the code, next one not starting until previous one finished 
      - //second useEffect will NOT run until fetchEvents is run, so will set group session at the beginning of fetchEvents
   



# Potential future additions 

   - not allowed to get passed workspaces unless session groupID variable is set
   - add cooldowns to API calls to prevent from SPAM
   - more profile storage editing (storing phone number)
   - if adding 'teacher page' just add a dropdown for signup/login to specify whether student or teacher 
   - notify users of password requirements so they don't have to trial and error
   - email verification 
   - make session validation with RIN  a module. 
   - remove all window.locations for smother navigation
      - figure Out what to replace with
   - add back in storage of major/class, and editing functionality in 'future' folder
   - ALLOW COLOR SUPPORT FOR MORE THAN 3 CLASSES
